<h1>The Best Adult Animation According to Alex (No weird stuff)</h1>

<h2>My top 3 animated tv series</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Bojack Horseman</h3>
<p>I watched this show during a low point of my life. 
If you follow bojacks story youll find that he lives a life that isn't exactly admirable.
However, at times you begin to relate to the horseman. Constantly trying to change yourself inorder to feel 
close to the one around you just to fall short again and again. Pretty Good. Would watch again</p>

<h3>Smiling Friends</h3>
<p>Smiling friends is a breath of fresh air during a time where evey adult animation wants to be the next Rick and Morty.
Don't get me wrong, I love Rick and Morty but I also love variety. As random and unconventional Rick and Morty is, Smiling friends takes it to the next level.
You will alwasy go into a new episode not knowing what to expect. I love it.</p>

<h3>Over the Garden Wall</h3>
<p>This one isn't a adult animation, but i still had to add it. Over the garden wall is a darker cartoon made for kids, but still worth the watch.
The story is powerful but where this show really shines is in the music. The music is trully a work of art. You'll more then likely 
leave each episode with a new song stuck in your head. My favorite is "The Highwayman".</p>

<h3>Scanvengers Reign</h3>
<p>Shits nice. I don't even have to hype it up or anything. Sit down, spark one up and watch some weird alien shit</p>
